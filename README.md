Notes:

* The Makefile and .gitlab-ci.yml files are set up to run on Ubuntu.
* The .gitlab-ci.yml file uses the targets in the Makefile.
* These are the tools/commands/apps used:
  * Compiler: g++
  * Style Check: cpplint
  * Static Check: cppcheck
  * Coverage Check: gcov/lcov
  * Memory Check: valgrind
  * Unit Test: gtest 
  * Documentation: doxygen
* See the version report on the pipeline.

Certain assumptions have been made:
* One repo contains the files for one project.
* All unit testing files are found in <code>test/</code> including <code>main.cpp</code>.
* All header files for the project are found in <code>include/</code> and named <code>*.hpp</code>, every class must have a header file.
* All project source files for the project are named <code>*.cpp</code>.
  * Any needed source files that correspond to header files are found in <code>src/</code>.
  * There is a <code>main.cpp</code> found in <code>src/project/</code>.

Our group held a meeting where each member present their own UML deisgn for discussion. Through collabrative feedback and discussion, we developed a revised UML diagram that incorporated the best ideas from each deisgn. 
John and Patrick then took the responsibility for creating the final version of the UML diagram and preparing the report, which they submitted on behalf of the group. we also agreed to hold two coding sessions during reading week to advanced our project.
